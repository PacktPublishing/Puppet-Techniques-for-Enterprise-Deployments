## About the Video Course

Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows you to automate all your IT configurations, giving you control over what you do to each Puppet Agent in a network, and when and how you do it. In this age of digital delivery and ubiquitous internet presence, it's becoming increasingly important to implement scalable and portable solutions, not only in terms of software, but also the systems that run it.

This video course will begin by covering methods of reporting with Puppet and configuring various types of open source dashboards along with procedures to use report processors and create custom ones. You will then exploit PuppetDB to configure and create efficient Puppet reports and also to monitor Puppet changes and alert based on the same. Finally, you will learn about how to implement Nagios based monitoring using Puppet.

Towards the end of the video course, you will concentrate on Puppet security. You will also learn about procedures to secure the Puppet deployments and methods to harden infrastructure using community modules. Finally, we’ll learn how to debug errors in the Puppet environment.
